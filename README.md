## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am BÃ¡rbara Borges.

I am a Bioinformatics MSc candidate at BioME (UFRN - Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil). 
I am a member of [@integrativebioinformatics](https://github.com/integrativebioinformatics) lab at Unidad de GenÃ³mica Avanzada (UChile - Santiago) and ARIA (UFPB - JoÃ£o Pessoa, ParaÃ­ba, Brazil).

Transriptomics and Genomics are the umbrella areas of my current projects.

I have been mostly working on lncRNA discovery and characterization coming from long-read RNA-seq, and also on some side-projects involving RNA modifications, transcriptome and genome assemblies.

I am learning Nextflow and looking foward to contribute to and collaborate with the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) community.

I consider myself to be an RNA-girl, and I am very interested on transcriptional complexity, specially non-coding RNAs and Alternative Splicing.
